{% spaceless %}
{% if task.cache.user_state == "disabled" %}
It appears you already have a user account that was disabled. We've reactivated it, but because it may have been a while we've reset your password. After you setup your new password you will be given access to your new project and will be able to login.
{% else %}
You will be asked to define a password, after that you will be given access to the project and will be able to login.
{% endif %}
{% endspaceless %}

This link expires automatically after 24 hours. If expired, you can simply go to the dashboard and request a password reset.
